## Purpose
- Provide a debugging tool for language that has less debugging tool ( especially Bluespec and minispec) For educational purpose

## General Idea
- We generate a code that basically add a printf statement to any point in the code that involve assigning variable/ state
- TODO: Create a real debugger from those output

## Currently Working on
- Create a Minispec Parser ( Using Bluespec reference guide)
- Will add display statement later
